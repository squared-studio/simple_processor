Components and Data Flow:


Program Counter (PC):
  The PC holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
  It is updated with the address of the next instruction (PC + 2) or a branch address.

Instruction Fetch:
  The instruction fetch unit retrieves the instruction from the Instruction Memory based on the address in the PC.
  A "valid" signal indicates whether the fetched instruction is valid.
  
Instruction Decode:
  The instruction decode unit interprets the fetched instruction, determining the operation to perform and identifying the source and destination registers.
  It accesses the instruction memory to get the instruction to be decoded.
  
Register File:
  Contains multiple general-purpose registers (e.g., 8 registers labeled Rx).
  During the decode phase, the source registers (Rs) are read.
  The destination register (Rd) is written during the write-back phase.
  
Execute:
  The execute unit performs arithmetic or logical operations based on the decoded instruction.
  It uses the data from the source registers (Rs) and produces a result.
  This unit interacts with the data memory for load and store instructions.
  
Instruction Memory:
  Stores the instructions to be executed.
  Instructions are fetched from here based on the address provided by the PC.
  
Data Memory:
  Used for load (reading data) and store (writing data) operations.
  The address for these operations is generated by the execute unit.
  
Control Signals and Paths:
  Boot Address: The initial address loaded into the PC at the start (boot) of the processor.
  Valid: A signal indicating the validity of the fetched instruction.
